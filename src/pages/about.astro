        <div class="mt-8 space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            I'm Ben — a self-taught full-stack developer who believes in understanding the full stack,
            literally. Not just "frontend and backend," but the infrastructure those apps run on,
            the networks that connect them, and the systems that keep them secure.
          </p>

          <p>
            My journey started with frontend development — React, TypeScript, building UIs that feel
            fast and intuitive. But I quickly realized that understanding the backend made me a better
            frontend developer. And understanding infrastructure made me better at both.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, I run a homelab that would feel familiar to anyone working in DevOps: Proxmox clusters,
            pfSense firewalls with proper VLAN segmentation, Cloudflare Tunnels for secure access,
            self-hosted services like Nextcloud and Plex. It's not just a hobby — it's how I learned
            networking, security, and systems thinking in a way that directly improves my application development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm looking for a role where I can contribute to meaningful products, work with smart people,
            and keep learning. I'm especially interested in positions that value engineers who can think
            across the stack and aren't afraid to dig into unfamiliar territory.
          </p>
